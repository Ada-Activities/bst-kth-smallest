# Binary Search Tree Kth Smalles Class Activity 

This repository is the classroom activity for the Binary Search Trees Roundtable in Unit 4.

## Learning Goals 
- Practice creating and maintaining a binary search tree in python
- Practice traversing a binary search tree in python
  
## One-Time Activity Setup

Follow these directions once, at the beginning of the activity:


1. Navigate to the folder where you wish to save activities. This could be your `projects` folder, or you may want to create a new folder for all of your activities.

   If you followed Ada's recommended file system structure, you can navigate to your projects folder with the following command:

   ```bash
   $ cd ~/Developer/projects
   ```

   Or, if you want to create a new folder for all of your activities:

   ```bash
   $ cd ~/Developer
   $ mkdir activities
   $ cd activities
   ```

   If you've already created an activities directory, you can navigate to it with the following command:

   ```bash
   $ cd ~/Developer/activities
   ```

2. In Github click on the "Fork" button to fork the repository to your Github account.  This will make a copy of the activity in your Github account. 

3. "Clone" the activity into your working folder. This command makes a new folder named for the activity repository, and then puts the activity into this new folder.

   ```bash
   $ git clone <clone_url_for_the_activity>
   ```

   The `<>` syntax indicates a placeholder. You should replace `<clone_url_for_the_activity>` with the actual URL you'd use to clone this repository. If you click the green "Code" button on the GitHub page for this repository, you'll see a URL that you can copy to your clipboard.
 
   Use `ls` to confirm there's a new activity folder

4. Move your location into this activity folder

   ```bash
   $ cd <repository_directory>
   ```

   The `<repository_directory>` placeholder should be replaced with the name of the activity folder. If you're not sure what the folder is named, remember that you can use `ls` to list the contents of your current location.

5. Create a virtual environment named `venv` for this activity:

   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   ```

6. Activate this environment:

   ```bash
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Verify that you're in a python3 virtual environment by running:
   
   - `$ python --version` should output a Python 3 version
   - `$ pip --version` should output that it is working with Python 3

7. Install dependencies once at the beginning of this activity with

   ```bash
   # Must be in activated virtual environment
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Not all activities will have dependencies, but there will still be an included `requirements.txt` file.

Summary of one-time activity setup:
- [ ] Fork the activity repository
- [ ] `cd` into your working folder, such as your `projects` or `activities` folder
- [ ] Clone the activity onto your machine
- [ ] `cd` into the folder for the activity
- [ ] Create the virtual environment `venv`
- [ ] Activate the virtual environment `venv`
- [ ] Install the dependencies with `pip`

## Activity Development Workflow

1. When working on this activity, always ensure that your virtual environment is activated:

   ```bash
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. If you want to work on another project from the same terminal window, you should deactivate the virtual environment when you are done working on the activity:

   ```bash
   $ deactivate
   ```

## Classroom Activity

### Kth Smallest

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the keys (values) of the nodes in the tree. It is guaranteed k will be smaller than the size of the tree.

For this exercise, consider the key and value to be the same.

### Example 1:

*Input*:

           6
         /   \
        /     \
       3       8
      / \       \
     1   5       9
     
`k = 3`

*Output*: 5

*Explanation*: The 3rd smallest value in the tree is 5.

### Example 2:

Input: 

            5
          /  
         /     
        3       
       /         
      1          
     /             
    0

`k = 1`

*Output*: 0

*Explanation*: The 1st smallest value in the tree is 0.

## Running Tests
Use the tests provided in the `test_kth_smallest.py` file to verify that your code is working correctly. You can verify the tests are working in one of two ways:

1. Run `pytest` in the terminal (make sure you are in the venv!)
2. Set up the testing environment in the VSCode Testing Pane
   1. Click on the beaker icon and click `Configure Python Tests`
   2. Select `pytest` from the list that appears
   3. Select `tests` from the new list that appears.
3. Verify the tests show up in the Testing Pane.
4. Run the tests to make sure they are all passing!
